# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Its packages and engine are this repository's (Ferrum docs/plan/erp-repo.md, stage 3): the
  packages accounting, inventory, buying, selling and manufacturing (`packages/`, byte for byte as
  workspaces have them, so nothing changes in a workspace and the version stays) and the engine on
  them (`src/`: ledger, open items, stock valuation, selling and buying, manufacturing and MRP,
  company set-up, the books' reports), which Point of Sale, Commerce, Assets, Field Service, HR
  and CRM build on. ferrum-domain keeps what every app shares.
- Countries plug in through `localization`: their rules for taxes (inside `pricing::calculate`, so
  ERP's documents and other apps' priced ones get them alike), checks before submitting and a new
  company's set-up. India is the first, now the add-on `ferrum-india` (`addons/india`) with GST,
  e-invoices and e-way bills. Its rules act only for companies in India (or naming no country): a
  company elsewhere in the same workspace gets no GST accounts, templates or checks. Every priced
  document gets the GST template for its place of supply, as invoices do: Commerce's carts and
  prices for a signed-in customer and Procurement's supplier quotations now too.

- ERP has a repository of its own (Ferrum docs/plan/erp-repo.md, stages 1 and 2): its manifest
  and India's, its interface (`ui/`, at `/erp/` and on the workspace's portal; built and committed
  in `ui/dist` and compiled into this crate), and its add-ons Finance, Procurement, Stock
  Operations and Manufacturing Operations (`addons/`, with their tests). The interface now draws
  the records frame from Ferrum-Frontend's packages (`@ferrum/records/frame`), as other apps'
  interfaces do. Its packages and their logic are still the platform's (stage 3). Earlier history
  is in the Ferrum and Ferrum-Frontend repositories.
